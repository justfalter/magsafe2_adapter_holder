Concerned that I would lose $15 Apple Magsafe 2 converter, I designed this holder  
to easily attach to my old Magsafe power cable using a rubber hair-tie.  

It was printed using PLA at 0.2mm height.   

You can find the OpenSCAD source for this model in [the github repository](https://github.com/justfalter/magsafe2_converter_holder).  

You can download the model as well as see pictures of the final product on the [thingiverse page](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1013189).
